My personal implementation of http://swapi.co/ using Graphql
I'm currently working on, the API is not termnated yet.


## Installation
Once the project cloned in your environment:
	npm install

## First start ever
* grunt getSwapiData - This download swapi data into local jons file
* npm start

# Other Starts
npm start is enough. Whenever you want to update your data, do a grunt getSwapiData and restart the server.

# Overview
This GraphQL returns data about Star Wars, just like http://swapi.co/api/ does through a REST API.
Data are downloaded localy into json files from swapi. GraphQL queries simpy search into this data)
