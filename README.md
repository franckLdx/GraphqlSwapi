# GraphqlSwapi
My personal implementation of http://swapi.co/ using Graphql

This GraphQL returns data about Star Wars, just like http://swapi.co/api/ does through a REST API.
Data are downloaded localy into json files from swapi. GraphQL queries simpy search into this data)

## Installation
Once the project cloned in your environment:
	npm install

## First start ever
* grunt getSwapiData - This download swapi data into local jons file
* npm start

## Other Starts
npm start is enough. Whenever you want to update your data, do a grunt getSwapiData and restart the server.


# API
To query a GraphQL API, one can use either get or post. Even if it's less 'HTTP way', I prefer to use post
in my examples because queries content are more readable. Do to so we must set our content type to 'application/graphql': !['application/graphql image'](./doc/content-type.png)
